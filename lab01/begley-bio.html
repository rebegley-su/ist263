        I am a sophomore studying Television, Radio & Film and Information Management & Technology at Syracuse University. I am interested in a career in the entertainment industry. I am currently a writer for Moody Magazine, a radio host on Z89, and a head writer at Citrus TV. Outside of work/school, I love to read, listen to music, and spend time with my friends & family.
